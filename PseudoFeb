// summary: new pseudo code (they're just notes) as of february, meant to reorganize the existing code into modules that are easily parsable by main.cpp

flow:
0. Create a tab array for each text feed file
1. Scan all subdirectories for existing text feed files
2. For each text feed file, create an item vector array
3. Generate a tab for each text feed file
4. Populate each tab with its respective item vector array
5. Done!


priorities array
ASAP, URGENT, HIGH, NORMAL/HIGH, NORMAL/MEDIUM, NORMAL/LOW, LOW

can only use one of those entries in the array

{"","ASAP","URGENT","HIGH","NORMAL/HIGH","NORMAL/MEDIUM","NORMAL/LOW","LOW"}
